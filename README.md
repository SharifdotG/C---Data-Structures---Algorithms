# C & CPP Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains the Hand Notes & Implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C and C++. This repository is created using the help of the course of **Abdul Bari** on **Udemy**. The course is named as "[Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/)". The course is very helpful for beginners to understand the concepts of data structures and algorithms. The course is very well explained by Abdul Bari. I highly recommend this course to beginners.

I have created this repository to keep track of my learning and to help others who are looking for the implementation of data structures and algorithms in C and C++. I have also added **my own hand notes** of the course in the repository. The hand notes are very helpful to understand the concepts of data structures and algorithms. I have also added the implementation of the data structures and algorithms in C and C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured in the following way:

- **Hand Notes**: The hand notes of the course are added in the repository. The hand notes are very helpful to understand the concepts of data structures and algorithms. The hand notes are added in the [Hand Notes](/00%20-%20Hand%20Notes/) directory.
- **Implementation**: The implementation of the data structures and algorithms in C and C++ are added in the repository. For now I have added the implementation of the following parts in the course:
  - [Essential C abd C++ Concepts](/01%20-%20Essential%20C%20and%20C++%20Concepts/): This part contains the implementation of the essential C and C++ concepts that are required to understand the data structures and algorithms throughout the course. These concepts include:
    - Arrays
    - Structures
    - Pointers
    - References
    - Pointer to a Structure
    - Functions
    - Parameter Passing Methods
    - Arrays as Parameters
    - Structures as Parameters
    - Different Styles of Programming (Modular, Monolithic, Object Oriented, etc.)
    - Class and Constructor
    - Template Class
  - **More parts will be added soon.**
